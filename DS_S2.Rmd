```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
adv = read.csv('./Advertising.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

```{r}
fit1 = lm(sales ~ tv + radio + newspaper, data = adv)

fit1$coefficients

fit2 = lm(tv ~ radio + newspaper, data = adv)

residuals = fit2$residuals

fit3 = lm(sales ~ residuals, data = adv)

fit3$coefficients
```
the coefficients for tv in full model and for residuals are the same
